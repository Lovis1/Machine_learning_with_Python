# ML with Python: Digit Recognition
This is a project in the course 'Skills: Programming - Introductory level' at the University of St. Gallen.

In this project I have applied three Machine learning models to perform digit recognition on Lecun's, Cortes's and J.C. Burges's MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
I have oriented myself with Ahmad Bazzi's tutorial "Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier - Machine Learning # 2" from june 2020 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXpsCyXXMJE) for binary classification and with Karlijn Willems's tutorial "Python Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn tutorial" from february 2019 (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-python) for Principal components analysis (PCA) and a clustering model (K-Means algorithm).

* The code is written with Python, and is divided into two parts, which make for two jupyter notebooks: 
   1. Binary Classification using SGD-Classifier
   2. Principal Component Analysis and Clustering with K-means

* Each part (SGD-Classifier *; PCA; Clustering) is built according to the analogue four steps: 
   1) Importing the dataset
   2) Preprocessing the data
   3) Applying machine learning models and visualizing results
   4) Model Performance

*In addition to these 4 steps, the notebook on Binary Classification (first one) contains a part on ''exploring the dataset'', which is not repeated in the second notebook. 

Informations on packages and required modules to run the MNIST dataset are provided inside the code.
