# Machine_learning_with_Python
This is a project in the course 'Skills: Programming - Introductory level' at the University of St. Gallen.

In this project I have applied three Machine learning models on Lecun's, Cortes's and J.C. Burges's MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
I have oriented myself with Ahmad Bazzi's Tutorial "Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier - Machine Learning # 2" from june 2020 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXpsCyXXMJE) for binary classification and with Karlijn Willems's Tutorial "Python Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn Tutorial" from february 2019 (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-python) for Principal components analysis (PCA) and a clustering model (K-Means algorithm).

* The code is written with the Python, and is divided into two parts, which make for two jupyter notebooks: 
   1. Binary classification using SGD-Classifier
   2. Principal component analysis and Clustering with K-means

* Each part (SGD-Classifier *; PCA; Clustering) is built according to the analogue four steps: 
   1) Importing the dataset
   2) preprocessing the data
   3) applying a machine learning model and visualizing results
   4) Model Performance

*In addition to these 4 steps, the Notebook on Binary Classification (first one) contains a part on ''exploring the dataset'', which is not repeated in the second notebook. 

Informations on packages and required modules to run the MNIST dataset are provided inside the code.
